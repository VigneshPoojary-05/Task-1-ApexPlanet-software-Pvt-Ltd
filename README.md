# 🌟 Interactive Webpage – Internship Task  

This is my **first internship project** at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd**, where I created a fully responsive and interactive webpage to demonstrate the **three foundational web technologies**:  
- 🏗️ **HTML** – for clean structure and semantic markup  
- 🎨 **CSS** – for styling, responsiveness, and modern UI effects  
- ⚡ **JavaScript** – for interactivity and dynamic content
